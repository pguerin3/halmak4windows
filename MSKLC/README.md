# Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) Version 1.4

The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator allows users to create or modify keyboard layouts.

Ever wanted to quickly and easily define your own keyboard layout for a language Microsoft doesn't support? Or define your own keyboard layout so you can quickly and easily enter your favorite symbols with a simple keystroke? Well, want no more: the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator is here!

The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator extends the international functionality of Windows 10, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems by allowing users to:
* Create new keyboard layouts from scratch
* Base a new layout on an existing one
* Modify an existing keyboard layout (.KLC) file and build a new layout from it
* Package the resulting keyboard layouts for subsequent deployment and installation.

This minor update to MSKLC fixes several customer-reported bugs in diverse areas such as support for the Tibetan Tsek character on the spacebar and support for ligatures in the AltGr shift state.
