# The Halmak Keyboard Layouts for Windows

This repository is the Windows equivalent of the original Halmak Apple Mac version:
[halmak](https://github.com/MadRabbit/halmak)

This repository contains 4 Halmak layouts in 2 groups.
The groups are:
 * Halmak (featuring HalmakP and HalmakLG).
 * HalmaQ (featuring HalmaQP and HalmaQLG).

Note - HalmakQP and HalmaQLG map to the Qwerty layout for control characters.
This means undo (cntrl-z), cut (cntrl-x), copy (cntrl-c), and paste (cntrl-v) and the other control characters are in their original Qwerty positions on the keyboard.

Regardless of the group, the lettering of the Halmak layout is the same and is as follows:

### HalmakP and HalmaQP

This group has the Halmak layout with the parenthesis at the centre:
- HalmakP: features the parenthesis at the centre, and the Halmak cntrl keys.
- HalmaQP: features the parenthesis at the centre, and the Qwerty cntrl keys.

This means with the shift key modifier the layout is as follows:

- HalmakLG: features the less/greater at the centre, and the Halmak cntrl keys.
