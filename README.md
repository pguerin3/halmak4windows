* Logout then login. There is no need to reboot.

* On startup you'll see the Input Method icon in the task bar. This can be set to instead show the Input Method icon in the top-right corner of the desktop where you'll be able to easily switch to either layout with the mouse. 

* Now you can switch at any time to the layout that you want.
