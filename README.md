## Installation

This repository contains 2 Halmak layouts:
- Halmak: has the base Halmak layout, but retains the Qwerty cntrl key layout.
- HalmakX: has the Halmak layout for the base and cntrl keys.

Halmak maps to the Halmak layout for normal characters, and the Qwerty layout for control characters.
This means undo (cntrl-z), cut (cntrl-x), copy (cntrl-c), and paste (cntrl-v) and the other control characters are in their original Qwerty positions on the keyboard.

HalmakX maps to the Halmak layout for both normal and control characters.
This means undo (cntrl-z), cut (cntrl-x), copy (cntrl-c), and paste (cntrl-v) and the other control characters are in their new Halmak positions on the keyboard.

Execute either or both of the following to install Halmak:
 - halmak/setup.exe
 - halmakX/setup.exe

* Logout then login. There is no need to reboot.

* On startup you'll see the Input Method icon in the task bar. This can be set to instead show the Input Method icon in the top-right corner of the desktop where you'll be able to easily switch to either layout with the mouse. 

* Now you can switch at any time to the layout that you want.
